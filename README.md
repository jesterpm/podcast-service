Podcast Service
===============

Podcast Service provides a restful interface for managing a set of podcasts. The
system is targeted towards podcasting church services. The system pre-renders
the web pages and podcast XML files when podcasts are added/modified/removed,
rather than rendering them dynamically on each page load.
